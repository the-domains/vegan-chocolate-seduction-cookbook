Like
a warm heartthrob for a special someone, the chocolate, ginger, and
sweetness of these treats will engulf you with other-worldly delight.
They are a ginger lover's variation on the classic peanut butter
"Hollywood Squares" that I enjoyed in elementary school, and
perhaps you did, too. If this addiction has also followed you into
adulthood, these will satisfy you.

**Seductive
Activity Idea: **Make your pookie bear a dessert care package to take to work. Include a note telling them a reason or two that they make your heart throb, and what you'd like to do with them that evening. Tell them they can't open their care package until lunch time---and not in front of their boss or co-workers. (By the way, if you're a kitchen-phobic guy, this is your opportunity to earn even more brownie points with your partner. Just do it.)
