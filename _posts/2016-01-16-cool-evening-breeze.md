Dark
chocolate and coffee meet mint and ice, reminiscent of a refreshing
romantic evening when it's great to snuggle up with your loved one.
This drink is a fine treat for the spring or summer, or even in the
middle of winter if you find yourself craving warmer days.

**Seductive
Activity Idea: **Find
a comfy place to settle down next to your poodle noodle to enjoy your
drinks. Wear a minimal amount of clothing, especially if it's a
really warm day. Between sips or after finishing, create your own
sexy evening breeze by connecting with each other through your
breath. You might start with a warm, slow hot breath into your poodle
noodle's ear. Or perhaps a cool, slightly harder blow through
puckered lips, making little circles on the inside of their forearm.
Lick sensitive body parts to moisten them, and then gently blow on
them to create different sensations. Make occasional erotic
vocalizations while blowing, and use your creativity. Take turns and
enjoy the subtle sensations.
