Dark
chocolate and coffee meet mint and ice, reminiscent of a refreshing
romantic evening when it's great to snuggle up with your loved one.
This drink is a fine treat for the spring or summer, or even in the
middle of winter if you find yourself craving warmer days.

**Seductive
Activity Idea:**

Find a comfy place to settle down
next to your poodle noodle to enjoy your drinks. Wear a minimal
amount of clothing, especially if it's a really warm day. Between
sips or after finishing, create your own sexy evening breeze by
connecting with each other through your breath. You might start with
a warm, slow hot breath into your poodle noodle's ear. Or perhaps a
cool, slightly harder blow through puckered lips, making little
circles on the inside of their forearm. Lick sensitive body parts to
moisten them, and then gently blow on them to create different
sensations. Make occasional erotic vocalizations while blowing, and
use your creativity. Take turns and enjoy the subtle sensations.
